# Fuji-Website
Website for Fuji Dental Lab

The purpose of this website is to allow our clients access to their online orders as well as check the status of their orders. 

ISSUES:
The JS code only works for the index.html and not the other pages. The issue first happened when moving all nav bar CSS over to it's own file rather than have it all in the style.css file. I have made call functions for all pages however it refuses to read the other pages.
